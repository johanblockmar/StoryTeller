# StoryTeller

The idea of this project is to wright a simple python based "Choose your own adventure" style, story telling game.

## Structure

The story will be divided into pages where each page tells a part of the story.
Each page will have one or more options on how to proceed with the story where each option will lead to another page.  
The actual story text with options should be written in an external file that is read by the program.
